* Two-Hour Course: Functional Programming with Pair and List Operations in JavaScript

** Course Overview

This course aims to introduce you to the key concepts of functional programming with a focus on pair and list operations using JavaScript. We'll start by understanding the provided code snippet and then explore the concepts of functional programming, pairs, lists, and their operations. You'll also learn about higher-order functions, closures, and how to build more complex data structures using simple primitives. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid understanding of how to use pair and list operations for functional programming in JavaScript.

- Explore additional resources on functional programming and JavaScript
- Experiment with building complex data structures using pairs and lists

** Additional Notes

For the course, it is expected that participants have a basic understanding of JavaScript and programming concepts. Each section will include code examples and test cases to reinforce the concepts learned. A Q&A session will be held at the end of the course to address any questions or concerns participants may have.

This is a high-level course outline, and the course can be further expanded with detailed content, interactive examples, and hands-on exercises. The course can also be adapted to different formats, such as online or in-person workshops.
Example of Section 2: Understanding the Code Snippet

In this section, let's take a closer look at the provided code snippet:

#+BEGIN_SRC javascript
const pair = (f, r) => (op) => op(f, r);
const first = (p) => p((f, r) => f);
const rest = (p) => p((f, r) => r);

console.log(first(pair(1, 2)));
#+END_SRC

Here, we have three functions: pair, first, and rest. Let's understand what each function does and how they work together.
